# Cryptax

Crypto is full of endingless opportunities. However, there are some things I currently despise:
- Why the heck can't my app show my total returns over the **maximum** time period?
- Why do we have to create tax reports ourselves in Germany?
- Do I really have to pay for a service just to nicely print my (few) transactions?
- Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? Ok, this could be tricky...

Cryptax is my little project to make crypto life less messy. The idea is simple:
- **Keep track of your portfolio** — finally see the total returns over maximum time period. Either through the terminal, or build a nice dashboard
- **Automate tax stuff** — generate a German-compliant tax report without the headache
